    "# Greedy Algorithms\n",
    "1. What is Greedy Algorithm\n",
    "* A Greedy Algorithm is a method where:\n",
    "* at each step. You make the best choice(the most \"greedy \"choice) without worring about the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You only think\n",
    "* \"what looks best right now\"\n",
    "* Goal: By picking the best opition at every step. You hope to get the best overall solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why is it called Greedy Algorithm\n",
    "* Because at every decision point.\n",
    "* you grap the best immediate opition- without thinking about thr bigger picture, Like a greedy person who grabs the biggest piece of cake without planning for other.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How greedy algorithms works\n",
    "* Start from the first point.\n",
    "* At each step, Pick the best possible choice.\n",
    "* Move to the next step based on that choice.\n",
    "* Repact until the end.\n",
    "* you never go back to fix your previous choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Improtant Points:\n",
    "* Greedy algorithms always don't give the prefect answer for every problem.\n",
    "* But for some problems, Greddy gives the best (optimal) Solution.\n",
    "* For other, It gives a good enough solution, but not perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Real-Life Example (Easy to understand)\n",
    "* Coin Chnage problems(Choosing largest coin first)\n",
    "* Imegine you have to make 27 rupees  using of 25 10 5 and 1 rupees\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Greedy Approach\n",
    "* Pick the largest coin possible at each step.\n",
    "* 25 (1 coin)-> 27 ->25== 2\n",
    "* 1 (2 coins)->2-> 1->1== 0\n",
    "* Total coins used : 1+2 = 3 coins\n",
    "* Here ,greedy gives a good answer\n",
    "\n",
    "8. When does the Greedy works prefectly\n",
    "* Greedy work when:\n",
    "* Greedy choice properity:\n",
    "* choossing the best local opition also leads to the best global solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Final Tips\n",
    "* Always think making the best current choice will lead to the best final answer\n",
    "* If yes- Greedy Works\n",
    "* if no - You may need other methos( Like dynamic Programming)\n",
