    "# --> Sliding Window <--\n",
    "1. What is the sliding Window Technique\n",
    "* Imagine you're looking though a window that shows only a few items at a time -- Like 3 eords in a sentence, 3 house in a row, or numbers in list.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instead of analyzing the entire list over and over. you focus on what's inside the window , and then you slide the window one step forward- to the next group of items.\n",
    "* It's A way of breaking a big problem into a small parts, moving step by step, and reusing what you already know instead of starting from scratch each item.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [1,2,3,4,5,6.7]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Real-life Analogy : Train window\n",
    "* Picture yourself on a moving train, Looking out the window.\n",
    "* you can only see a few houses at a time- let's say 3.\n",
    "* As the train moves to forward, you don't go back to the beginning to look again.\n",
    "* you just let go of the house that passed, and look at the new house that just appeared.\n",
    "* That's how the sliding window works.\n",
    "* you can process one group of items, slide forward, adjust what changed. and keep going - first and match.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When Do you use the sliding window\n",
    "* you use it when the problems involve array or string thing in a row.\n",
    "* you're working with a group of consecutive (next to each other) Elements.\n",
    "* you're asked to find something like:\n",
    "* The maximum/minimum (e.g .Longest/Shotest substring or subarray)\n",
    "* whether a certain pattern or condition is meet\n",
    "* instead of checking every possibility from the beginning (which is slow ),You just slide and update.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Two main types.\n",
    "1. Fixed -size Window\n",
    "* The size of window is set and doesn't change.\n",
    "* Example: Find the highest Average of 3 test score ib a row\n",
    "* you slide one element at a time . always looking at 3 times.\n",
    "2. Variable -Size Window\n",
    "* The window grows or shinks depending on conditions,\n",
    "* Example: \"Find the shotest part of a video that includes all improtant scenes.\n",
    "* You expand untill you meet the condition, then shirks to make it as small as possiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Why is it better than brute force\n",
    "* Brute force means checking every possibility- which is like walking to each house, writing down its' value and starting over each time. Its'slow.\n",
    "* Sliding window means you remember what you just saw, And only update the part that changed- which makes it much faster in techniccal term. you can improve the spped from 0(N2) to 0(N) (Fast), which is a huge difference.\n",
