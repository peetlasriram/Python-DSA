    "# Topological Sort\n",
    "1. What is Topological Sort\n",
    "* Topological Sort is a linear ordering of the vertices of a Directed cycle Graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge U-->V, Node U comes before node V in the Ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When is Topological Sorting Applicable.\n",
    "* Only work on Directed Acycle Graph (DAG)\n",
    "* If the graph has a cycle -> Topological sort is not Posssiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Real-Life Example /Use Cases\n",
    "* Usage:--> Explanation\n",
    "* Task Scheduling :-->Some tasks must be done before Other\n",
    "* Course Prerequisites:--> Take Course A before Course B\n",
    "* Build Systems:--> Compile Dependencies in the correct order\n",
    "* Job scheduling :--> Jobs With dependency Constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Two Approaches to Topological Sort\n",
    "* We can do topological sorting using either\n",
    "* DFS(Depth First Search)\n",
    "* kahn's Algorithm(BFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1. DFS-based Topological Sort\n",
    "* * Perform DFS on Every unvisited node\n",
    "* * Once DFS is finished for a node, add it to the Result list.\n",
    "* * Finally.Reverse the result list.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2. Kah's Algorithms(BFS-Based)\n",
    "* * Count in-degrees of all nodes (Number of incoming edges)\n",
    "* * Start With nodes that have in-degree 0 (no Dependencies)\n",
    "* * use a queue to preocess nodes and reduce in-degree of neighbors.\n",
    "* * if neighbor's in-degree 0--> add it to queue\n",
    "* * Collect Nodes in order\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Getting Dressed Example\n",
    "* imagine you're getting dressed, and some items depend on others.\n",
    "* 1. Put on socks\n",
    "* 2. put on shoe (only after A: Socks)\n",
    "* 3. put on shirt\n",
    "* 4. put on pants\n",
    "* 5. Put on belt (only after D: Pants)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Here's how Khan's Algorithm finds the order:\n",
    "* * Find the what's ready First: You can start with A (Socks),c(Shirt),and d(pants) because nothing need to happen before them.\n",
    "* * put these in your \"to-do\"pile\n",
    "\n",
    "* pick one and see what unlock\n",
    "* let's say you pick a(socks).once socks are on, now you can put on B (Shoe), add B to your \"todo\" pile Remove A.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Next you pick D (pants). once pants are on, now you can put on E (belt)\n",
    "add Eto your \"todo\" pile Remove D.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you pick C (Shirt) nothing new unlock , remmove C\n",
    "\n",
    "* keep going untill everything Done.\n",
    "* 'You're \"To-do\" pile noe has B (Shoes) and E(BELT)\n",
    "* Pick B(shoes).remove B\n",
    "* Pick C(belt ) Remove E\n",
    "\n",
    "* You have successfuly dressed\n",
    "* A valid oredr you just found could socks be: Socks  pants.Shirts, shoes, BELT.\n",
    "* Khan's Algorithm ensures you never try to put on shoes before socks.\n",
    "* or a belt before pants\n",
    "\n",
    "6. DFS vs khan's (BFS) -Comparsion\n",
    "* Feature  --> DFS approach  --> Khan's (BFS)approach\n",
    "* Uses----> Stacks-->Recursion-->Queue(BFS)\n",
    "* Datect cycle --> No ---> Yes (by checking out size)\n",
    "* output order -->needs to be reversed--> Built in correct order\n",
    "* Easy to understand-->yes--> yes ( if familiar with BFS)\n",
    "* preferred when-->You want recursion style --> you want in-degree logic or cycle detecion\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Time and space Complexity\n",
    "* Operaion --> DFS-Based-->Khan's (BFS)\n",
    "* Time ---> O(V+E)--->o(v+e)\n",
    "* space--> O(v+e)-->o(v+e)\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Advanatages \n",
    "* Help sehedule tasks in correct order\n",
    "* efficient (liner time)\n",
    "* useful in many real-world problems\n",
    "* detect cycle (via kahn's)\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Disadvantages\n",
    "* Works only on DAG's\n",
    "* connot find unique topological order if multiple are possiable (unless modified)\n",
    "* Doesn't give shortest or longest paths unless extended (like in DP on DAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Summary \n",
    "* Topic ---> Explanation\n",
    "* Topo sort Defination --> Ordering of DAG vertices U-->V where U come before V\n",
    "* works only on --> DAS's(Directed Acyclic Graph)\n",
    "* DFS Topo Sort--> post-order DFS+ reverse\n",
    "* Kahn's Algorithm--> In-degree tracking + BFS Queue\n",
    "* time complexityn--> O(v+e)\n",
    "* use Cases --> task planning, biild order, courses\n"
