    "# Dijkstra's Algorithms\n",
    "1. What is Dijkstra's Algorithm.\n",
    "* Dijkstra's Algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a source code to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When to use Dijkstra's Algorithm\n",
    "* You have a graph with non- negative edge weight\n",
    "* you want the shortest path from one source to every other node.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ideal for problems like\n",
    "* minimum cost to reach all cities\n",
    "* network packet routing\n",
    "* GPS shortest Route/\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Why not use BFS or DFS\n",
    "* BFS works only for unweighted graph\n",
    "* DFS doesn't  qurantee the shortest path.\n",
    "* Dijkstra guarantee the shortest path for weighted graph (with non-negative weights)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How Dijkstra's Algorithms works(step-by-step)\n",
    "*  use a priority queue (min-heap) to always pick the node with the shorttest current distance. Start with the source node and distance = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explorw all Adjacent neighbors.\n",
    "* if the path though the current node is shorter,update the distance. Repeat untill all nodes are visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Time and space complexity\n",
    "* Components --> Complexity\n",
    "* Time (min-heap) -->O((V+E)*log v)\n",
    "* space ---> O(v+E)(for adj list + dist array + heap)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Advantages\n",
    "* Efficient work for large graph with non-negative weights.\n",
    "* works well with priority queue (min-heap)\n",
    "* Guarantees the shortest path\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Disadvantages\n",
    "*  Doesn't not work with negative edges weight (use bellman -ford instead)\n",
    "* Not optimal for all pairs shortest path (use floyd-warshall for that)\n",
    "* Slower than A* in some cases with a specific target (A* uses Heuristics)\n",
    "\n",
    "9. summary \n",
    "* Feature ---> Dijkstra's algorithm\n",
    "* Graph type --> Directed or undirected, non - negative weights\n",
    "* goals-->shortest path from 1 source to all nodes\n",
    "* Data Structure --> min-heap + Adjacency List\n",
    "* Greedy --> Yes\n",
    "* Negative weights--> No\n",
    "* output --> List of shortest Distances"
