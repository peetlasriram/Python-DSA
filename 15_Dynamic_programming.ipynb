    "1. What is Dynamic Programming\n",
    "* Dynamic programming (DP) is method to slove problems by breaking them into smallet parts, Solving each part only once, And reusing the answer later when  needed\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Real-Life Analogy - Math Exam with Caching.\n",
    "* Imagine you're taking a math exam, you solved a difficult multiplication in one questions.\n",
    "* 34 X 41 == 1517\n",
    "* Later, in another questions, You need the same calculation again.\n",
    "* would you redo it? No\n",
    "* you would just use the answer you already found -1517\n",
    "* this is exactly what dp Does. It remember answer to smaller problems and reuse them to solve the big one faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. why and when to use Dp\n",
    "* Use Dp when the problem has:\n",
    "1. Overlapping subproblems\n",
    "* you solve the same small problem again and again.\n",
    "* Example: In Fibonacci number, to find fib(5), you nees fib(4) and fib(3)-- but fib(3)--is used agin in fib(4)\n",
    "2. Opitimal Substructure\n",
    "* the final answer depens on opitimal answer to smaller problems\n",
    "* Example :- To reach the minimum cost, you need to know the minimum cost of previous steps.\n",
