    "# BellMan-Ford Algorithms in DSA\n",
    "1. What is Bellman-Ford \n",
    "* The Bellman-ford algorithm is graph algorithm used to find the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph, even if the graph contains negative edge weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How it works.\n",
    "* Initialize distance to all nodes as (Expect the source =0)\n",
    "* Relax all edges n-1 time (where n= number of vertices)\n",
    "* After n-1 relaxation, all shortest paths will be found.\n",
    "* optionally, run one or more pass to ditect a negatiive weights cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When to use Bellman-Ford\n",
    "* Situation ---> Use Bellman ford if\n",
    "* Graph has negative  edge weights --> Yes\n",
    "* you need to detect a negative weight cycle --> yes\n",
    "* you want shortest paths from one source to all nodes ---> yes\n",
    "* Graph is small or medium- sized --> yes\n",
    "* Graph is very large with only positive weights --> use Dijkstra instead (faster)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. key terminologies \n",
    "* Term ---> Meaning\n",
    "* Edges Relaxation --> the process of upadating the shortest distance to a node.\n",
    "* Negative weight edge --> An edge with a negative cost ( e.g ,-5)\n",
    "* Negative weight cycyle ---> A cycle where the total weight becomes negative forever\n",
    "* Source node ----> The starting point from which all shortest paths are calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. time and space complexity \n",
    "* Time --> O(V * E) where (v = number of vertices),(E= number of edges)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Why (We loop though all edges for v-1 times)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Space complexity -->O(v) only one distance[] array to store shotest distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Advantages\n",
    "* Feature ---> Explanation \n",
    "* Works withh negative weighs ---> Unlike Dijkstras\n",
    "* Can detect negative weight cycle --> important in graph where weight can decrease over time.\n",
    "* simle logic using basic loops --> No fancy data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Disadvantages\n",
    "* Slower that Dijkstra ---> time complexity is higher, specially for dense graphs\n",
    "* Not suitable for very large graphs ---> O(v+E) to bee Slow\n",
    "* Doesn't work with undirected negative edges --> Because it leads to negative cycle  easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Real-world uses Cases\n",
    "* Currency Arbitrage ( Detecting negative cycle in exchange rates)\n",
    "* Routing Algorithms where weights can be negative (e.g.with refunds or penalities)\n",
    "* Network protocols where conditions may change dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Final Summary\n",
    "* Aspect --> Bellman ford \n",
    "* Purpose ---> Shortest paths from a single Source \n",
    "* handle Negative --> yes\n",
    "* Detect Cycles --> yes ( negative weight cycle)\n",
    "* Time complexity --> O(VxE)\n",
    "* space complexity ---> O(V)\n",
    "* Better than Dijkstra only if negative or cycles are involved.\n",
