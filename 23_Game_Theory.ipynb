    "# Game Theory\n",
    "1. What is a GameTheory\n",
    "*  Game theory is the Study of decision -making between two or more playes.\n",
    "* In DSA. Game theory helps us solve problems where:\n",
    "* Two players take turns\n",
    "* Each playe plays optimally (smartly)\n",
    "* The goal is to determine the winner or maximum again\n",
    "* you're not simulating the whole game--you're predicting the outcome using logic, recursion, and dynamic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example Problem: Nim Game, Stone Game, Coin Game, Predict the winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When to use Game Theory\n",
    "* Use Gametheory in DSA When:\n",
    "* Two players play alternatively\n",
    "* Each playes plays optimally (not ramdomly)\n",
    "* the game's rules are fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* you're asked to find \n",
    "* who will win\n",
    "* what's the best move.\n",
    "* what's the maximum/ minimum score possiable\n",
    "\n",
    "* Key words in problems statements.\n",
    "* \"two players\"\n",
    "* \"Take turns\"\n",
    "* \"Play optimally\"\n",
    "* \"Find who wins\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Key terminologies in gametheory\n",
    "* Term     | Meaning\n",
    "* Game State | the current situation (e.g. Remaining Coins, Stones)\n",
    "* Move    | An action a player can take on their turn\n",
    "* winning State | A game state where a player can force a win\n",
    "* Lossing State | A game state where every move leads to awin for the opponent\n",
    "* optimal play  | Always making the best possiable move\n",
    "* minimax strategy | to minimize opponent's gain and maximize your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Time and Space complexity(General Idea)\n",
    "* Most game theory problems are solved using\n",
    "* 1. Recursion\n",
    "* * Time : o(2*N)(exponential)\n",
    "* * Space Complexity : o(n) (Stack Space )\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2. Recursion+ Memorization (top-Down Dp)\n",
    "* * Time o(n) or o(n*2) (based on state space)\n",
    "* * Space complexity : O(n*2) (for memo table)\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3. Bottom -up DP ( Tabulation)\n",
    "* Time: O(n) or O(N^2)\n",
    "* Space : O(n) or o(N^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "* It depends on Size of Game state ( Array, Stones,turn.etc)\n",
    "* Number of variable on each state (Position, turn,etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Advantages \n",
    "* Predict outcome : you can predit if the first or second player will win.\n",
    "* Optimize decisions : Helps in making smart moves instead of brute force.\n",
    "* Learn DP : Most game theory problems are good partice for dynamic programming.\n",
    "* Used in contests: Common competitions (Nim Game, Stone Game, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Disadvantages\n",
    "* Hard to identify : It's not always obvious that it's game theory problem\n",
    "* Recursion can be slow : without memorization, it may lead to TLE (Time limit Exceeded)\n",
    "* opitimal play is tricky : You need to think for both players\n",
    "* State Explosion : Conplex game may have too many states\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Summary Table\n",
    "* Topics--Description\n",
    "* What:-> Strategy--based 2 playes game in DSA.\n",
    "* when to use :--> Alternate turns, opitimal play, winner prediction.\n",
    "* Key Terms:--> Game state, Winning state, losing state, opitimal move,\n",
    "* Time/space :--> usually o(n) or o(n2) with memorization.\n",
    "* Advantages:--> Great for DP, Contents, outcome prediction.\n",
    "* Disadvantage:--> can be hard to spot. Need careful planning.\n",
